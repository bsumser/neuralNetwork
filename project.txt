** Project Name: Breakfree

**Project Repository: breakFree folder on my uoregon-cis330 repo

** Team Members: Brett Sumser

** Description:
	Will be a clone of the popular game breakout, with the paddle and ball.
	Object of the game is to break all the bricks in a level and move on to the next.
	Class encapsulation for different objects in game, including possible powerups.
	For game art I plan to use the SDL 2.0, which has a fair amount of 
	open source game art.
	
**Implementation Approach:
	Will be using C++ classes for the ball, paddle, and breaks.
	Want to include a few powerups that affect gameplay, and different levels as well

**Risk Management Plan:
	Plan is to work for at least 2 hours every day. 
	Attempt to finish at least 1 class a week.
	Research 2d physics to apply to powerups changing ball speed/trajectory
