RED WINES: CABERNET SAUVIGNON For many, Cabernet Sauvignon is the king of wine grapes, and the Cabernets from certain vineyards in Napa, Sonoma and other areas of California are among the very best anywhere. In less than thirty years, California wineries making Cabernet Sauvignon have gone from candidates to authorities, so that even wine makers in Bordeaux are studying (and copying) the styles and methods of California Cabernet. In Washington’s Columbia, Yakima and Walla Walla appellations, these “Bordeaux Varieties” are world-class. With the intense hot days and cold nights of these regions, the wines develop great fruit and structure. More and more Cabernets from Washington’s hot arid climate are also attaining this high quality.

RED WINES: CABERNET FRANC Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style. It can also be vinified alone and is increasingly found in Washington, California, and Italy. Cabernet Franc is lighter in color than Cabernet Sauvignon with the same level of intensity and richness. The first Cabernet Franc varietal wine released in Washington was by Columbia Winery in,1991. California, while perfectly warm enough to ripen Cabernet Sauvignon, produces some particularly rich forms of Cabernet Franc. The variety is increasingly well-regarded in Tuscany, particularly in Bolgheri on the Tuscan coast. We invite you to explore and enjoy our selection of this fascinating varietal.

RED WINES: ZINFANDEL
Zinfandel is a black-skinned grape indigenous to Croatia that made its way to Italy where it is known as Primitivo.  The plantings there are predominantly in the heel region of Apulia.  Sometime in the mid,1800s the grape made its way into California where it has become a mainstay of California’s wine identity.  Zinfandel is stylistically very versatile with wines that range from bright and lively to deeply brooding and port-like, depending on the soils and climate where it is grown and the winemaker’s intention.  We bring you an interesting cross section of our southern neighbor’s offerings.

RED WINES: IBERIA, SPAIN Top quality, food friendly wines from the Iberian Peninsula have been recognized since at least the Roman era. Typically blended from indigenous grape varietals such as Tempranillo, Touriga, Grenache, Carignan and Graciano, these wines have a capacity to age long periods or to be enjoyed young. In the,1980s, wine makers moved away from the traditional extended aging in old oak, toward a deeper, fruit-forward international style, using newer oak barrels and at times adding small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. We find these wines to be a natural companion to our style of regional cuisine.

VINTAGE PORTS Port has changed very little since its origins in the,1800s. The grapes are picked, crushed and fermented quickly. After about two days the must is fortified with neutral spirit, which arrests the fermentation and leaves some sweetness. While other kinds of Port are aged for many years, vintage Port is bottled unfiltered after only two years.
